# Policy-iteration

## Policy Iteration Algorithm Implementation

This repository presents an Implementation of Policy Iteration from scratch, as described in the book by Barto and Sutton. The algorithm serves as a fundamental reinforcement learning technique for solving environments and generating optimal policies.

### About the Project

The project focuses on solving a deterministic grid world environment where an agent learns to navigate while considering obstacles and the cost associated with each step. By implementing the policy iteration algorithm, the project aims to generate policies that guide the agent to reach the goal while minimizing the number of steps and maximizing rewards.

The algorithm iteratively evaluates and improves policies until convergence, ensuring that the agent learns to efficiently reach the goal while considering the environmental constraints.

### Pseudocode Reference

The pseudocode utilized in this implementation was extracted from the book authored by Barto and Sutton. Please refer to the provided picture for the pseudocode.
